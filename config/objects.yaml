# Object definitions for ArUco-based detection
# All dimensions in cm, angles in degrees

# ArUco dictionary: 6x6_50 for objects/walls
# Types: "goal" (marker 0), "movable" (pushable boxes), "static" (walls)
# Marker IDs: 0 = goal, 1-9 = objects (movable by default)

  # Goal marker (marker 0 is reserved for goal)
  goal:
    marker_id: 0
    type: goal

  # Movable boxes (5cm cubes) - markers 1-9
